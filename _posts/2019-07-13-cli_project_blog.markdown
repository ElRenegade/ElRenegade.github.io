One thing I learned from this first project is to definitely not procrastinate. I took my time a little too much and i ened up have to scramble and think of a different site to use for my project. The site I was initially going to use was not scrapable so I had to switch it. I am not very creative to begin with so thinking of one idea was challenging enough. As i mentioned it took me a while to get going but once I did I really enjoyed the process and got a real taste of what programming really is. I had a lot of fun(with some frustrating moments) but seeing the progress and making my program run was very satisfying. I look forward to learning more and the projects ahead!
